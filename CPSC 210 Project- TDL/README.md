# *No Log Event*
No task is being added to your to-do list

No task is being deleted from your to-do list

# *Phase 4: Task 3*
- Created task and to-do list class in my project that will be necessary for the entire project to work.
Tasks created will be shown/saved in the overall to-do list and display to the users under the help of 
GUI JPanels/JFrames/JButtons....etc. Users can also save/load the previous to-do list, as well as check
how many tasks are completed within the to-do list. Once users are satisfied and decided to start over, they
can simply delete the tasks and clear the # of completed tasks within the program. The Event and EventLog 
are there to help print out the activities. If I had more time, I would improve my code by reduce the coupling and 
increase the cohesion of my code. Hence, improve the readability, quality and maintainability of my overall code. 
I also would add more visualization to my project to make it prettier.
